# hyperiondev-project

My favourite bit of code that i have written for this project would be the dropdown navbar both in desktop and mobile view. This is because previously i use to struggle so much in trying to make the dropdown work properly and now with practice, i have managed to get the dropdown working the way i wanted it to. Another reason why it's my favourite piece of code in this project is because it uses jQuery to manipulate the HTML elements of the navbar to create transitions. This makes the UI much more user friendly for the user to navigate.
